## Getting started
The easiest way to try this starter is to run it locally on your computer.

## Backend
Open terminal tab, and make sure you're in the frontend directory:
```
cd backend
```
Install dependencies
```js
npm install
```
Rename .env.example to .env

Setting your database in .env file

We use mongodb on this project

Start Backend
```
npm run develop
```
It is running here => http://localhost:1337/admin

After that you have to register for logging in to the backend and then setting permission like this.

![setpermission1](https://strapiuploadtoey.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/setpermission1.jpg)

![setpermission2](https://strapiuploadtoey.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/setpermission2.jpg)

## Frontend
Access to the frontend directory:
```
cd.. & cd frontend
```
Install dependencies
```js
npm install
```
Start Frontend
```
npm run dev
```
Next server is running here => http://localhost:3000
